Containers will be tracked in and out of our facility via booking reference numbers which will only be issued by our customers as part of our security protocol. Import laden containers arriving at our depot will have container numbers and seal numbers noted on the transporters documents for easy reference to book the containers into the depot and stack in the respective slots for each client. Export laden containers will be tracked out of the depot with container and seal numbers as well booking release instructions so as to maintain proper security protocol. </div>
